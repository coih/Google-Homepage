# Notes: 
This is a spin-off of the popular web browsers homepage, Google.
I've demonstrated abilities for layout such as: using floats, horizontally centering and aligning, etc. As well as html form knowledge.


## Further Notes: 

Media Queries will be added shortly. As well as design enhancements. (Created on a small screen laptop- this would explain why things appear smaller on large screen- will fix that shortly :))
